### Traffic Analysis

Dynamic analysis of the traffic exchanged between client and server can be performed by launching a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This can be achieved by using an interception proxy like Burp Suite (Professional) or OWASP ZAP for HTTP traffic.

In case another (proprietary) protocol is used in a mobile App that is not HTTP, the following tools can be used to try to intercept or analyze the traffic:

### Fuzz Testing
Fuzz testing, is a method for testing software input validation by feeding it intentionally malformed input.
Fuzzing include following steps:
* Identifying a target
* Generating malicious inputs
* Test case delivery
* Crash monitoring

Note: Fuzzing only detects software bugs. Classifying this issue as a security flaw requires further analysis by the researcher.
